Adding Adviser Description Labels

# The Problem Description
At WIMI we have an Adviser Description label that is fairly stagnant and does not present us with enough information. I am attempting to relabel Advisers based on their client profile. This would include the number of products that the client holds as well as the value he has placed in each. In the short term it will give us more insight into adviser involvement in WIMI outflows and inflows.The end goal could be to better allow us to match Wimi clients with advisers.
